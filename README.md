Software for interacting SRF Cavities and NDX detectors for Field Emission Data Acquisition

## Overview
This software is used to control the RF settings and NDX detectors associated with a linac so that we can collect data useful in modeling field emission.

## NOTICE
This software is being converted to CSUE.  The csue-dvl branch has the most up-to-date code until the conversion is complete.
